3.1.	When user taps on one of the employee, it navigates to the employee details screen

4.1.	When user taps on one order, it navigates to the order details screen to see details of the order, such as, customer information, order date, shipping status etc
## Instructions:
You will be using hardcoded lists to display data. Data can be loaded and displayed on listing screen (products list, employees list, orders list). Further navigating from the listing screen will send the data to the next screen.
Implement proper navigation flow with the appropriate header information of each screen.
Home screen does not need to have the header
