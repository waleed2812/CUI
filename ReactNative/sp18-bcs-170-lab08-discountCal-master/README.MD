# Lab 08. Discount Calculator

When we go out for shopping especially when there is sale on different shops and outlets. Most of the times, discount percentage is specified along with original price. Every time we need to calculate the price after discount, and we do this repeatedly for each item on sale.  

To solve this issue, we are going to develop a small React Native Application which will calculate the discount.  

## Task # 1  

Create and initialize a React Native project on your local machine. Make it a git repository and push the initial code on GitHub.  

## Task # 2  

This is a simple app at this stage and contains two input fields:  
 * Original Price  
 * Discount Percentage  

## Task # 3

Before moving to this task, Push the Code on GitHub.  
Implement the functionality of the App. As soon as user type the Original Price or Discount Percentage, Display following information:  
 * You Save
 * Final Price  
 
## Task # 4

Before moving to this task, Push the Code on GitHub.  

Design and improve the look and feel of the App (Add nice header on the top, Color Scheme, Alignment of the Content, Font-Size etc).   
Adding constraints on the input fields, such as, it can take only Numbers and Positive Numbers, Discount cannot be greater than 100. Calculated amount should be 2 decimal points.  

## Task # 5
Before moving to this task, Push the Code on GitHub.  
This feature is not present in most of the apps available on App Stores. Sometimes, we move around during shopping and want to come back and see the after-discount price again of the item, to avoid typing again the required inputs, we want to maintain a history of the calculations we performed.  
Now, the question is, when do we save the calculations? We can provide a Save Button to save the calculations and View History.  
In this task, we save the calculations with the save button  

## Task # 6
Before moving to this task, Push the Code on GitHub.  
A button will help the user to see the history. Use Modal (https://reactnative.dev/docs/modal) to display the history of calculations.  
It should contain following information:  
 * Original Price
 * Discount Percentage
 * Price After Discount
